I get the jitters ahead of things like this, and I'm channeling 
that into making sure I have everything teed up ahead of time.  My plan for `Readme.md`
 is to note some details about the environment followed by field notes I'll jot 
 down as I progress toward a solution.
 
 My first assumption is that I'll be using Python as a scripting language.  Some or all of the 
 project may be written in Bash, depending on the ask(s).
 
 ## Environment
 * IDE: PyCharm 2020.1 Professional
 * OS: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS running in WSL
 * Scripting language(s)
     * Python 3.6.8
     * Bash 4.4.19(1)-release
